# Zoo-Station
Custom WordPress website (https://cf-zoostation.net). "**Zoo Station: some footnotes**". A collection of visual and multimedia footnotes added to the book “Zoo Station: The Story of Christiane F.” (Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo)
## Technical details
The whole website is built based on an open-source template called Lovecraft (https://wordpress.org/themes/lovecraft/). Here is a list of the main customizations:
* Big part of the graphical aspects and user interface
* The pages dedicated to the quotes are developed on Custom Types and Custom Fields
* The navigation through the quotes list, the upload of the single quotes and the switch between the languages are handled by asynchronous calls
* Embedded code for SVG animations: CSS for animation, JS for interaction
* The map page (https://cf-zoostation.net/space/) employes Google Maps API
